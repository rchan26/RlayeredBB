**Note:** I have not completed documenting and exporting the functions in the `R/` folder in this package - on my to do list.

## To install, use `install_github` from `devtools` package

```
devtools::install_github('rchan26/RlayeredBB')
```

**Note:** see [here](https://github.com/rchan26/layeredBB) for a C++ and Rcpp implementation of this package - this is better.
