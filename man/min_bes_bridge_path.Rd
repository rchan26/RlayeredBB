\title{Bessel Bridge path sampler given minimum}
\usage{
min_bes_bridge_path(x, y, s, t, min, tau, times, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{start value of Bessel bridge}

\item{y}{end value of Bessel bridge}

\item{s}{start value of Bessel bridge}

\item{t}{end value of Bessel bridge}

\item{min}{minumum point}

\item{tau}{time of minimum point}

\item{times}{vector of real numbers to simulate Bessel bridge}

\item{plot}{boolean value: defaults to F, determines whether or not to plot the simulated Bessel bridge}
}
\value{
matrix of the simulated Bessel bridge path, first row is points X, second row are corresponding times
}
\description{
This function simulates a path of a Bessel bridge at given times, given minimum occurs at time tau
}
\examples{
# simulating a path at times=c(0.2, 0.4, 0.8) for a Bessel bridge starting at 0 and ending at 0 in time [0,1] given minimum is at -0.4 at time 0.6
min_bes_bridge_path(x = 0, y = 0, s = 0, t = 1, min = -0.4, tau = 0.6, times = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.8))
